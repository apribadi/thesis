\section{Binary Values and Statistical Models}

\section{Algebraic Statistics}

    Algebraic statistics is a relatively new field that examines statistical
    questions using algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  Once a problem
    has been cast in the language of algebra, a number of computational tools
    can be brought to bear.  For example, one of the early papers in the field
    analyzed contingency tables using Monte Carlo sampling computed with Gr√∂bner
    bases \citep{DS98}.

    Algebraic statistics also offers a geometric point of view on statistical
    models; the tendency is toward intrinsically defined objects in lieu of
    explicit coordinate systems.  In this light, algebraic statistics might be
    seen as in the tradition of information geometry, a field pioneered in the
    1980s that applied the techniques of Riemannian geometry to probability
    models (see for example \citep{Ama}).

    An introduction to the field of algebraic statistics may be found in the
    collection of lecture notes \citep{DSS08}.  Algebraic statistics has also
    been applied to computational biology \citep{ASCB}.


\chapter{The Geometry of Statistical Models}
    \section{The Probability Simplex}

    We consider probability distributions over finite sets.  The space of all
    such distributions corresponds to a geometric object.
    
    \begin{definition} 
        \index{simplex}
        The \emph{probability simplex} of dimension $N$ (also
        called the \emph{standard simplex}) is the space
        \[
            \Delta_N = 
            \left\{(x_1, \ldots, x_{N+1}) \vbar \sum_{i=1}^{N+1} x_i= 1, x_i \ge 0 \right\} 
            \subset
            \R^{N+1}.
        \]
        If the appropriate dimension is either clear in context or irrelevant we
        may simply write $\Delta$, omitting the subscript.
    \end{definition}
    A \emph{simplex} in general is the image of a standard simplex under any
    affine transformation.  Low-dimensional simplices are familiar objects;
    $\Delta_0$ is a point, $\Delta_1$ is a line segment, $\Delta_2$ is a
    triangle, and $\Delta_3$ is a tetrahedron.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \scalebox{1}{ \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/simplices.png} }
        \caption{Low-dimensional simplices.}
    \end{figure}
    \noindent A random variable $X$ with $N+1$ possible values corresponds to a point $x =
    (x_1, \ldots, x_{N+1})$ contained in the simplex $\Delta_N$ in a natural
    way; if $X$ takes values in $\{1, \ldots, N+1\}$, we set $P(X = i) = x_i$.
    We usually identify a probability distribution with its corresponding
    point in the probability simplex.  
    
    Statisticians are often concerned with families of probability
    distributions.  We identify such families with geometric spaces.
    \begin{definition}
    By the phrase \emph{statistical model}, we mean a subset $\Mod \subset
    \Delta$ of a probability simplex.
    \end{definition}
    \noindent A statistical model may be parametrized by a map $f: U \to
    \Delta$, for some space $U$ of parameters.  Usually, the space of parameters
    is a subset of a real affine space $\R^d$, and parametrizations are
    differentiable almost everywhere.  In the context of algebraic statistics,
    the parametrization is usually a rational function.
    \begin{example}
    A random variable $X$ following a binomial distribution with size $N$ and
    parameter $\lambda \in [0,1]$ takes a value $k \in \{0,\ldots, N\}$ with
    probability
    \[
        P_\lambda[X = k] = {N \choose k} \lambda^k(1-\lambda)^{n-k}.
    \]
    This is the number of heads produced by $n$ `coin tosses', where $\lambda$
    is the probability of a head.  The map $\lambda \mapsto P_\lambda$
    determines a parametrized statistical model $\{P_\lambda : \lambda \in [0,1]
    \} \subset \Delta_N$. The statistical model is a curve, i.e. a
    one-dimensional subspace, of the simplex.  

    Take $N=2$, which simulates two coin flips.  The three coordinates of a
    point in the model measure the probabilities that zero, one, and two heads
    will occur, respectively.
    \begin{figure}[H]\label{fig:binomial}
        \centering
        \vspace*{-0.2cm}
        \scalebox{1}{ \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/binomial.pdf} }
        \vspace*{-0.5cm}
        \caption{The binomial statistical model for $N=2$.}
    \end{figure}
    \noindent As the parameter $\lambda$ varies over $[0,1]$, the statistical
    model traces out the curve 
    \[
        \lambda \longmapsto \big((1-\lambda)^2, 2\lambda(1-\lambda), \lambda^2\big)
    \]
    in the simplex $\Delta_2$.  The final coordinate
    $P[X=2]$ does not need to be displayed, because we can compute it from the
    first two coordinates.  
    \end{example}
    
\section{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

    Suppose that some data are taken from an unknown distribution, and that we
    want to model the data using some statistical model $\Mod \subset \Delta$.
    A distribution matches the data well if the data are relatively probable
    given the distribution.  Throughout this section we use discrete
    distributions, though our definitions can be made more general.

    Let $\Mod = \{P_\theta : \theta \in U\}$ be a parametrized statistical
    model. A random variable $X$ distributed according to some $P_\theta$ has
    the probability mass function $p_\theta(x) = P_\theta[X = x]$.  Suppose that
    we have data $Z = \{z_1, \ldots, z_n\}$.  The data are generally assumed to
    be independent and identically distributed according to some unknown true
    distribution in $\Mod$.
    
    \begin{definition}
    The \emph{likelihood function} of $\theta \in U$ given the data $Z$ is
    \[
        L(\theta; Z) = \prod_{i=1}^n p_\theta(z_i).
    \]
    It is the probability that the observed data $Z$ would occur if the
    observations were independent and identically distributed and following
    $P_\theta$.  The \emph{log-likelihood function} is
    \[
        l(\theta; Z) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_\theta(z_i)
    \]
    and is often used in place of the likelihood function because it is additive.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
    The \emph{maximum likelihood estimate} of the true parameter is the
    parameter 
    \[
        \mle = \argmax_{\theta \in U} L(\theta; Z)
    \]
    that maximizes the likelihood (or equivalently the log-likelihood) of the
    data.
    \end{definition}

    The maximum likelihood estimate is not always well-defined.  The estimate
    might not be unique, as the maximal likelihood could be attained multiple
    times.  The estimate  might not even exist, as the model could be a
    non-closed subset of the simplex.  In practice, it is possible that an
    optimal parameter is not necessary and that a merely good one is sufficient.
    Standard numerical optimization techniques, e.g. those based on gradient
    descent or Newton's method, can handle many models.  A more precise
    knowledge of the geometry of a statistical model, however, can make maximum
    likelihood estimation easier.

\section{Solutions to the Likelihood Equations}

    Do I keep this?

    Here, we give a flavor of how algebro-geometric techniques can be applied to
    maximum likelihood estimation.  Our exposition follows Section 3.3 of
    \citep{ASCB} and Section 2.1 of \citep{DSS08}.

    Suppose that $g: U \to \Delta_{N-1}$ is a rational parametrization of a
    statistical model, where $U$ is an open subset of $\R^d$.  By rational, we
    mean that each component of $g(\theta) = (g_1(\theta), \ldots, g_N(\theta))$
    is a rational function with rational coefficients in its argument $\theta
    \in U \subset \R^d$.  Maximum likelihood estimation then amounts to
    maximizing the function
    \[
        l(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N u_i \log g_i(\theta)
    \] 
    where $u_i$ is the number of times event $i$ has occurred in the observed
    data.

    Every local and global maximum $\theta \in U$ is a solution to the
    likelihood equations
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:lik}
        \frac{\partial l}{\partial\theta_j}
        =
        \sum_{i=1}^N 
        \frac{u_i}{g_i} 
        \cdot
        \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial \theta_j}
        = 0
        \qquad
        \text{for $j = 1,\ldots,d$}.
    \end{equation}
    The likelihood equations in \eqref{eq:lik} are again rational functions of
    $\theta$.  Solving the equations involves `clearing denominators' and
    solving the polynomial equations
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:lik-clear}
        \sum_{i=1}^N 
        u_i \cdot g_1 \cdots \widehat{g_i} \cdots g_N
        \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial \theta_j}
        = 0
        \qquad
        \text{for $j = 1, \ldots, d$}
    \end{equation}
    where $\widehat{g_i}$ indicates that the $i$-th factor is omitted.  The
    equations \eqref{eq:lik-clear}, however, introduce extraneous solutions, for
    example when $g_a(\theta) = g_b(\theta) = 0$ for any $a \ne b$.

    Algebraic geometry offers a principled way to solve the likelihood
    equations.  (For a brief introduction to affine and projective varieties, see
    Section \ref{sec:varieties} of the appendix.)  Consider the ideal $I \subset \R[\theta_1,
    \ldots, \theta_d]$ generated by the polynomial expressions in \eqref{eq:lik-clear}
    \[
        I = \adel[\Bigg]{
            \sum_{i=1}^N u_i \cdot g_1 \cdots \widehat{g_i} \cdots g_N
            \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial \theta_j}
        }_{j=1}^d
        .
    \]
    Let $h$ be the product of all polynomials appearing in the denominators of
    the rational equations in \eqref{eq:lik}.  The \emph{saturation ideal} of
    $I$ with respect to $h$ is defined
    \[
        (I : h^\infty) = \cdel[\big]{
            f \in \R[\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_d]
            \;\big\vert\;
            fh^k \in I
            \quad
            \text{for some non-negative integer $k$}
        }.
    \]
    We can then consider the variety corresponding to the saturation ideal.  The
    points in $V(I : h^\infty) \cap U$ are all solutions to the likelihood
    equations.  In the case that there are only finitely many solutions, passing
    to the saturation ideal removes all extraneous solutions.

    The referenced works \citep{ASCB} and \citep{DSS08} include examples of
    computing the variety $V(I : h^\infty)$ with the software package
    \texttt{Singular}.  An overview of the techniques used to solve such
    polynomial equations, e.g. Gr√∂bner bases, resultants, and elimination, is
    given in the text \citep{CLO05} on computational algebraic geometry.

\section{Markov Random Fields}
    \label{sec:rbm-def}

    The Restricted Boltzmann Machine is an instance of a \emph{graphical model}.
    A graphical model is a probabilistic model for which a graph (directed or
    undirected) represents the conditional independence structure between random
    variables.  Several types of graphical models have become popular for
    applications in machine learning; Chapter 17 of \citep{EOSL} is an overview
    of undirected graphical models and additionally contains references to the
    large body of literature.  From the algebro-geometric point of view,
    graphical models in general are discussed in Chapter 3 of \citep{DSS08} and
    directed graphical models, known as \emph{Bayesian networks}, are discussed
    in \citep{GSS}.  In our exposition we only introduce undirected models.

    \begin{definition}
        We describe a \emph{Markov random field}, i.e. an undirected graphical
        model.  Let $G$ be an undirected graph with vertex set $V$.  Let
        $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in V}$ be random variables indexed by the
        vertices.  The joint probability of $(X_\alpha)_{\alpha \in V}$ is said
        to factor according to $G$ if for any pair of vertices $\beta, \gamma
        \in V$ that are not adjacent, the random variables $X_\beta, X_\gamma$
        are conditionally independent given the variables at the other vertices.
        That is,
        \[
            \text{$X$ and $Y$ not adjacent}
            \Longleftrightarrow
            X_\beta \perp X_\gamma \mid 
            \{X_\alpha; \text{for } \alpha \ne \beta, \alpha \ne \gamma\}.
        \]
        A Markov random field is any such collection of random variables that
        factor according to an undirected graph.
    \end{definition}

    Roughly speaking, the edges in the graph record which variables influence
    which other variables.  If the graph is relatively sparse, then there are
    strong restrictions on the interactions between variables.  For example, a
    totally disconnected graph indicates that the variables are all independent.
    In contrast, a complete graph places no restrictions at all on the
    variables' joint distribution.
    
    With the assumption that distributions are strictly positive, there is an
    equivalent characterization of a graphical model.

    \begin{theorem}[Hammersley-Clifford]
        The random variables $(X_\alpha)_\alpha$ indexed by the vertices of an
        undirected graph $G$ factor according to $G$ if and only if their
        joint probability density factors as
        \[
            p(x) = \prod_{S \in C(G)} f_S(x_S)
        \]
        where the $S$ are maximal complete subgraphs (cliques) of $G$, $x_S$ is
        the restriction of $x$ to $S$, and $f_S$ is a function on the variables in
        $S$.
    \end{theorem}

    The graphical models that we consider have a particularly simple structure;
    the variables have binary values and all interactions are pairwise.
    Following the machine learning literature, we refer to binary-valued random
    variables and their corresponding vertices as `units'.

\chapter{Symmetries of Binary Models}

\section{Desirable Symmetries}

    Consider a random variable $X$ with binary states, i.e. taking values in the
    set $\{0, 1\}^n = \{0\cdots00, 0\cdots01, \ldots, 1\cdots11\}$.  It is often
    the case that we do not want to use the meanings of these states to
    distinguish between them.  There are two natural symmetry requirements:
    \begin{itemize}\nospace
    \item The model is invariant under any permutation of the bits.
    \item The model is invariant under any `flip' of a bit.
    \end{itemize}

    We formulate these two requirements concretely.  Identify a probability
    distribution with the corresponding function from the space of states $\{0,
    1\}^n$ to probabilities in the interval $[0, 1]$.  Suppose that we want a
    model $\ms \subset \Delta$ to satisfy these symmetry requirements, and that
    some distribution $p$ is in the model $\ms$.  Then for certain permutations
    $g$ of the space of states $\{0, 1\}^n$, we require that
    the function
    \begin{align*}
        \{0, 1\}^n &\to [0, 1] \\
        b_1 \cdots b_n &\mapsto f(\inv g(b_1 \cdots b_n))
    \end{align*}
    is also a distribution in the model $\ms$.  A shuffling of the bits given
    by an element of the symmetric group $\sigma \in S_n$ is the permutation
    \begin{align*}
        \{0, 1\}^n &\to \{0, 1\}^n \\
        b_1 \cdots b_n &\mapsto b_{\sigma(1)} \cdots b_{\sigma(n)}.
    \end{align*}
    A flip of the $k$th bit is the permutation
    \begin{align*}
        \{0, 1\}^n &\to \{0, 1\}^n \\
        b_1 \cdots 0 \cdots b_n 
        &\mapsto
        b_1 \cdots 1 \cdots b_n  \\
        b_1 \cdots 1 \cdots b_n 
        &\mapsto
        b_1 \cdots 0 \cdots b_n
    \end{align*}
    where the only changed bit is in the $k$th position.

    These permutations are elements of the symmetric group on $\{0, 1\}^n$.
    They generate the group known as the hyperoctahedral group $S_2 \wr S_n$.
    The group acts of the space of all functions on $\{0, 1\}^n$ by permuting
    basis elements, that is, delta functions.  (Clarify?)  Thus $S_2 \wr S_n$
    has a natural action by linear transformations on the space $\R^{2^n}$, and
    then on the simplex $\Delta \subset \R^{2^n}$.  
    
    From a geometric perspective, we arrive at this notion of invariance.  With
    a group action $S_2 \wr S_n \le \mathrm{Aut}(\Delta)$, a model $\ms \subset
    \Delta$ is invariant under the group action if for any $g \in S_n \wr S_n$
    we have $g(\ms) = \ms$.

\section{Log-Linear Symmetries}

    The fact that $S_2 \wr S_n$ acts linearly on a linear space suggests that
    representation theory will be useful in understanding the symmetries of
    possible models.  A difficulty arises in that in the general case neither
    the simplex $\Delta$ nor a model $\ms \subset \Delta$ can be considered as
    linear spaces.  In the log-linear case, however, transformed versions of
    models are linear spaces, and techniques from representation theory are
    applicable.

    Recall the form of a log-linear model
    \[
        \ms_A = \cdel[\big]{}
    \]

\chapter{The Hyperoctahedral Group}

\section{Permutations of the Hypercube}

    The symmetry group of interest to us is the hyperoctahedral group.  This
    group may be defined as the automorphism group of the $n$-hypercube or as
    the wreath product $S_2 \wr S_n$.
% Coxeter?
    The first formulation is very concrete, so we describe it first. 

    Each joint state of the $n$ binary random variables can be represented as a
    binary string of length $n$.  That is, the states are
    \[
        \underbrace{
        \underbrace{0\cdots00}_\text{$n$ bits}\;,\;
        0\cdots01,\;
        0\cdots10,\;
        \ldots,\;
        1\cdots11
        }_\text{$2^n$ binary strings}.
    \]
    \begin{definition}
    The \emph{Hamming distance} between two binary strings is the number of
    positions in which the two strings differ.  
    \end{definition}
    For example, the following binary strings of length 4 have Hamming distances
    of 0, 1, and 2.
    \begin{align*}
        0010 &\xleftrightarrow{\quad\text{Hamming distance $0$}\quad} 0010 \\
        0010 &\xleftrightarrow{\quad\text{Hamming distance $1$}\quad} 0110 \\
        0010 &\xleftrightarrow{\quad\text{Hamming distance $2$}\quad} 0100
    \end{align*}
    The hypercube graph uses the Hamming distance to determine its edges.
    \begin{definition}\index{hypercube}
        The \emph{$n$-hypercube} graph has as its vertices the length-$n$ binary
        strings.  There is an edge between two vertices if and only if
        their Hamming distance from each other is 1, that is, if they differ in
        exactly one bit.
    \end{definition}
    The graph distance between any two vertices of the hypercube graph, i.e. the
    minimal number of edges between those two vertices, is the same as their
    Hamming distance.  A look at a picture of a hypercube graph
    (Figure~\ref{fig:hypercube}) makes it clear as to why it is called a
    hypercube.

    Speaking generally, the symmetries of an object correspond with a group
    action that preserves the structure of the object.  The structure of a graph
    is determined entirely by its edges.
    \begin{definition}
        A \emph{graph automorphism} is a permutation of the vertices of a graph
        that preserves the edges.  That is, a permutation $\sigma: V \to V$ is a
        graph automorphism if for every $(u, v) \in E$, we have $(\sigma(u),
        \sigma(v)) \in E$.
        The \emph{automorphism group} of a graph is the set of all
        automorphisms of a graph with the group operation being composition of
        permutations.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        The \emph{hyperoctahedral group} $H_n$ is the automorphism group of the
        $n$-hypercube.
    \end{definition}

    The wreath product is a construction on two permutation groups.
    Essentially, one permutation group shuffles copies of another permutation
    group.  In our example, $S_n$ permutes the binary variables, each of which
    has two states.  The copies of $S_2$ are each attached to one of the
    variables, and flip the values $0$ and $1$.  These copies of $S_2$ are then
    shuffled by the action of $S_n$.  We present a formal definition of the
    wreath product.
    \begin{definition}[\citet{Cam99}]
        Let $H$ and $K$ be permutation groups on the sets $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$
        respectively.  Let $\Omega = \Gamma \times \Delta$.  Think of $\Omega$
        as a fiber bundle over the set $\Delta$, with projection map $(\gamma,
        \delta) \mapsto \delta$; each fiber \mbox{$\Gamma_\delta = \{(\gamma, \delta)
        \mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}$} for fixed $\delta \in \Delta$ is isomorphic to
        $\Gamma$.  Let $B$ be the cartesian product of $|\Delta|$ copies of $H$,
        one acting on each fiber as $H$ acts on $\Gamma$.  Thus $B$ is the set
        of functions from $\Delta$ to $H$ with pointwise operations; the action
        on $\Gamma \times \Delta$ is given by
        \[
            f\cdot(\gamma, \delta) = (f(\delta) \cdot \gamma, \delta)
        \]
        where ($\cdot$) is used to denote group actions.  Let $T$ be a copy of
        the group $K$ permuting the fibers:
        \[
            k \cdot (\gamma, \delta) = (\gamma, k \cdot \delta).
        \]
        Then wreath product $H \wr K$ is defined to be the semidirect product $B
        \rtimes T$.
    \end{definition}

\section{Group Representations}
    
    The idea of representation theory is to better understand the possible
    inscrutable structure of a group (or algebra) by transferring over to the
    domain of linear algebra.  The field of representation theory is very rich,
    and we only introduce a few foundational concepts from the representation
    theory of finite groups.

    \begin{definition}
        A \emph{representation} of a group $G$ is a group homomorphism $\rho: G
        \to GL(U)$ from $G$ to the group of invertible linear transformations on
        a vector space $U$.  
    \end{definition}
    Here, we make the simplifying assumptions that $G$ is a finite group and
    that $U$ is a finite dimensional complex vector space.  It is common to
    identify the group representation $\rho$ with the vector space $U$; we then
    say that $U$ is the group representation.

    Representations of finite groups behave tractably in large part because they
    decompose well.
    \begin{definition}
        An \emph{irreducible representation} is
    \end{definition}
    \begin{theorem}[Maschke]
        A representation \ldots
    \end{theorem}

\section{Distance-Transitive Graphs}

    The hypercube graph is has a number of nice properties.  In particular, it
    is distance-transitive; this allows us to characterize some of its
    irreducible representations easily.
    \begin{definition}
        A \emph{distance-transitive} graph is a graph such that given any two
        vertices $u_1$ and $v_1$ at distance $d$ and any other two vertices
        $u_2$ and $v_2$ also at distance $d$, there exists some automorphism
        $\sigma$ of the graph with $\sigma(u_1) = u_2$ and $\sigma(v_1) = v_2$.
    \end{definition}

    Let $(V, E)$ be a graph with automorphism group $G$.  Let \mbox{$U = \{ f : V \to
    \C\}$} be the vector space of complex-valued functions on the vertices of the
    graph.  The group $G$ has a permutation representation on $U$ defined for $f
    \in U$ and $x \in V$ as
    \begin{gather*}
        \sigma(f)(x) = f(\inv\sigma(x))
    \intertext{or, equivalently defined on delta functions as}
        \sigma(\delta_x) = \delta_{\sigma(x)}.
    \end{gather*}
    The permutation representation of the automorphism group of a
    distance-transitive graph decomposes into the eigenspaces of a particular
    matrix.  The information characterizing a graph may be encoded in an
    adjacency matrix.  The adjacency matrix of the $2$-hypercube is show below.
    \[
        \raisebox{-2.75em}{
        \begin{tikzpicture}
          \node (00) at (-1, 1) {00};
          \node (01) at (1, 1) {01};
          \node (10) at (-1, -1) {10};
          \node (11) at (1, -1) {11};
          \foreach \from/\to in {00/01, 01/11, 11/10, 10/00}
            \draw (\from) -- (\to);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        }
        \quad\text{has adjacency matrix}\qquad
        \kbordermatrix{
               & 00 & 01 & 10 & 11 \\
            00 &  0 &  1 &  1 &  0 \\
            01 &  1 &  0 &  0 &  1 \\
            10 &  1 &  0 &  0 &  1 \\
            11 &  0 &  1 &  1 &  0 \\
        }
    \]
    Of course, the adjacency matrix of a graph may be viewed as a linear
    transformation on $U$.

    The following theorem makes precise the relationship between the
    decomposition of $U$ into irreducible representations with the eigenspaces
    of the adjacency matrix of the graph.
    \begin{theorem}[\citet{Sta84}]
        Let $G$ be the automorphism group of a distance-transitive graph.  Let
        $U$ be the permutation representation of $G$ on the complex-valued
        functions on the vertices of the graph.  Then $U$ decomposes as
        \[
            U = U_{\lambda_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus U_{\lambda_k}
        \]
        where the $\lambda_i$ are distinct eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix,
        $U_{\lambda_i}$ is the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda_i$, and the
        $U_{\lambda_i}$ are also distinct irreducible representations of $G$.
    \end{theorem}

    The adjacency matrices and eigenspaces for the $n$-hypercubes have a
    recursive structure.
    \begin{theorem}[\cite{CW06}]
        The adjacency matrix $Q_n$ for the $n$-hypercube, with vertices ordered
        lexicographically, is given by the following recursively defined block
        matrix
        \[
            Q_0 = \begin{bmatrix} \;0\; \end{bmatrix}
            \qquad
            \text{and}
            \qquad
            Q_n = \begin{bmatrix}
                Q_{n-1} & I \\
                I & Q_{n-1}
            \end{bmatrix}
            \qquad
            \text{for $n \ge 1$}
        \]
        where $I$ is the $2^{n-1}\times 2^{n-1}$ identity matrix.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[\cite{CW06}]
        If $v$ is an eigenvector of $Q_{n-1}$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$ then the
        concatenated vectors $\adel{v_1, \ldots, v_{2^{n-1}},v_1, \ldots,
        v_{2^{n-1}}}$ and $\adel{v_1, \ldots, v_{2^{n-1}}, -v_1, \ldots,
        -v_{2^{n-1}}}$ are eigenvectors of $Q_n$ with eigenvalues $\lambda +1$
        and $\lambda - 1$ respectively.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[\cite{CW06}]
        The eigenvectors of $Q_n$ are the Walsh functions of dimension $2^n$.
        The eigenvalues are given by $\lambda_k = 2k - n$ for $k \in \{0,
        \ldots, n\}$, and have multiplicity $\binom{n}{k}$.
    \end{theorem}

    These theorems give us a full characterization of the permutation
    representation of the hyperoctahedral group.



\section{Blah}

    We restrict our attention, as before, to log-linear models over binary
    variables.

    The actions listed above permute the $2^n$ states, and the permutations
    generate the hyperoctahedral group.  Thus, we are left with the stipulation
    that the model is invariant under the hyperoctahedral group.

    Geometrically speaking, for our model $\ms \subset \Delta$ and group
    action $\rho: H_n \to \mathrm{Aut}(\ms)$, we require
    \[
        \rho(g)(\ms) = \ms
    \]
    for any group element $g \in H_n$.

    With the decomposition of the permutation representation of the
    hyperoctahedral group into irreducible components, we can enumerate.

\chapter{A Little Algebraic Geometry}

    The field of algebraic geometry grew out of the study of curves and surfaces
    determined by polynomials.  In the mid-twentieth century, the foundations of
    the subject were reformulated by Serre, Grothendieck, and others.  The
    techniques of the field are notoriously both abstract and powerful; the
    following quote by the algebraic geometer David Mumford is perhaps telling
    \citep{Mum99}.
    \begin{quote}
        Algebraic geometry seems to have acquired the reputation of being
        esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly
        plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics.  In one respect this
        last point is accurate.
    \end{quote}
    More recently, the development of algorithmic techniques, e.g. Gr√∂bner
    bases, has spurred interest in the field of computational algebraic
    geometry.  A standard introduction to algebraic geometry from a
    computational perspective is \citep{CLO97}, which covers algebraic varieties
    and Gr√∂bner bases algorithms while assuming a relatively small amount of
    prerequisite knowledge.  The same authors have a graduate text \citep{CLO05}.

    Here, we introduce some classical algebro-geometric objects.  There are
    many good introductory textbooks for algebraic geometry, including
    \citep{Invitation}, \citep{Sha94}, \citep{Hart}, and \citep{Mum99}.

\section{Affine and Projective Varieties}
    \label{sec:varieties}
    Throughout, let $\F$ be a field.  It is useful to think of $\F$ being either
    $\R$ or $\C$.

    Let $\A^n$ be the affine space of dimension $n$ over $\F$ (that is, the
    vector space $\F^n$ where we view neither the choice of basis nor the choice
    of origin as canonical).  A polynomial $f \in \F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ can be
    considered as a function on $\A^n$ by simply evaluating the polynomial on
    any given point.

    \begin{definition}
        An \emph{affine algebraic set} is a subset of the affine space $\A^n$
        of the form
        \[
            V(f_1, \ldots, f_m)
            = \cdel[\big]{x \in \A^n \vbar f_i(x) = 0 \quad\text{for all $i$}}
        \]
        for some finite set of polynomials $f_i \in \F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.

        An \emph{affine variety} is an irreducible affine algebraic set, i.e. an
        affine algebraic set that cannot be written as the union of two proper
        affine algebraic subsets.
    \end{definition}
    \noindent Instead of a finite set of polynomials, we can equivalently
    consider a finitely generated ideal.  In fact, $\F[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a
    Noetherian ring, so the condition that the ideal be finitely generated
    condition is redundant.

    Given a subset $X \subset \A^n$, we may consider the ideal of polynomials
    vanishing on the subset
    \[
        I(X) = \cdel[\big]{f \in \F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \vbar f(x) = 0 \quad\text{for
        all $x \in X$}}.
    \]
    Under certain conditions (e.g. if the field is algebraically closed and the
    ideal is \emph{radical}), the operations $V$ and $I$ are inverses of each other.

    \begin{definition}
        The \emph{projective space} of dimension $n$ (usually denoted $\Proj^n$)
        is the space $\F^{n+1}\setminus \{0\}$ under the equivalence relation $x
        \sim \lambda x$ for $x \in \F^{n+1}$ and $0 \ne \lambda \in \F$.  The
        usual affine coordinate system on $\F^{n+1}$ modulo scaling gives
        \emph{homogeneous coordinates} $[x_0: \cdots: x_n]$ on $\Proj^n$.  If
        $\F = \R$ (resp.  $\C$), the homogeneous coordinates give $\Proj^n$ the
        structure of a real (resp.\ complex) manifold.
    \end{definition}

    It also turns out that projective space behaves particularly nicely for the
    purposes of algebraic geometry, for reasons that we will not describe here.
    Instead of arbitrary polynomials, a different collection of `functions' is
    used on projective space.
    \begin{definition}
        A \emph{homogeneous polynomial} in $n+1$ variables of degree $d$ is a
        polynomial of the form $F(x) = \sum a_I x^I$ where $a_I \in \F$ and the
        multi-index ranges over $I = (i_0, \ldots, i_n)$ such that $i_0 + \cdots
        + i_n = d$.  The monomials are defined to be $x^I = x_0^{i_0}\cdots
        x_n^{i_n}$.  A \emph{homogeneous ideal} is an ideal of $\F[x_0, \ldots,
        x_n]$ generated by homogeneous polynomials.
    \end{definition}
    Notice that if $F$ is homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$, then $F(\lambda
    x) = \lambda^d F(x)$ for $\lambda \in \F$.  The zero set of $F$ in $\Proj^n$
    is then well-defined.  It follows that we can define the projective analogue
    of an affine variety.
    \begin{definition}
        A \emph{projective algebraic set} is a subset of the projective space
        $\Proj^n$ of the form
        \[
            V(f_1, \ldots, f_m)
            = \cdel[\big]{x \in \Proj^n \vbar f_i(x) = 0 \quad\text{for all $i$}}
        \]
        for some finite set of homogeneous polynomials $f_i \in \F[x_0,
        \ldots,x_n]$.  A \emph{projective variety} is an irreducible projective
        algebraic set.
    \end{definition}
    As in the affine case, there is a well-behaved correspondence between the
    homogeneous ideals of $\F[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$ and projective varieties.

    Using these varieties, we may define the \emph{Zariski topology} on $\A^n$
    and $\Proj^n$;  the affine (or projective) varieties are the closed sets of
    the topology.  The Zariski topology is a bit unusual as, unless the field is
    finite, no variety is ever a Hausdorff space.

    For the applications encountered in algebraic statistics, we will need to
    venture into real algebraic geometry, the primary objects of which are
    slightly less well-behaved.
    \begin{definition}
        A \emph{semialgebraic set} is any subset of $\R^n$ of the form
        \[
            V = \cdel[\big]{ x \in \R^n \vbar
                f_i(x) = 0, g_j(x) > 0
            \quad\text{for all $i,j$}}
        \]
        for some finite collection of polynomials $f_i, g_j \in \R[x_1, \ldots,
        x_n]$.
    \end{definition}

    A more in-depth investigation into algebraic geometry reveals the central
    importance of rings of functions on spaces, and the need to consider
    arbitrary commutative rings.  This road leads to the theory of schemes,
    which we will neither need nor pursue here.
