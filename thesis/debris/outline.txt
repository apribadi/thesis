Symmetry and models
    geometry of models
    discrete multivariate
    model selection - bias vs variance
    how to choose models under consideration?
        linearity and invariance
        will be explained


log-linear models
    sufficient statistic on counts
    linearity on counts implies log-linearity of probabilities
    linear symmetries -> representations

symmetric models
    what are symmetric models
    wreath products for discrete multivariate models
    hyperoctahedral group
    hypercube graph
    representations

Model selection, revisited
    dimension penalties, AIC and BIC
    hypothesis testing
        markov bases for conditional distributions
    (invariant?) bases for sparsity, l_1 regularization

    eigenspaces <-> ith order effects
    nested spaces for model selection
        ref bishop for technique of going between i and i+1 order

Mixture models
    (this is a reach)
