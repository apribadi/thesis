Gelfand pair (?)
    2-chain G => H
    
    If for every H-irreducible V that contains H-invariant vectors, the
    decomposition of Ind_H^G V into G-irreducibles is multiplicity free.

    The only H-irreducible that contains H-invariant vectors is the trivial
    representation.

    Thus, (G, H) is a Gelfand pair if Ind_H^G triv_H is G-multiplicity free.

    The representation L(X) where X = G/H is a homogeneous space is the trivial
    representation of H induced up to G.

    So (G, H) is a Gelfand pair if and only if L(G/H) is multiplicity free.
